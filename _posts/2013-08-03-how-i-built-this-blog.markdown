Yes, I know, it is really cool for a programmer to build a blog writing all the stuff and experience he learnt in coding. I've been thinking about building this site for a long time (I really mean "a long time", sighâ€¦). And now we get here, eventually. Congratulation to myself!

Actually, I would like to use Octopress at first. I thought it is another static site generator, until I digged deeper on this yesterday. Thanks, God, this time I don't need to make a difficult choice again like I did between Python and Ruby. Octopress is just a framework for Jekyll. I simply chose Jekyll just because I like its [official website][jekyll].

To be honest, I cannot tell the difference between [Jekyll][jekyll] and [Jekyll-Bootstrap][jekyllbootstrap]. You can think Jekyll-Bootstap as another framework built on Jekyll to make bootstrap themes' switching much easier. Unfortunatly, I found it until I was trying to rake a bootstrap theme and got a `No Rakefile` error. Because I didn't choose to learn Ruby (Damn it!), now I have no choice but to use the default theme. But I'm pretty comfortable now after I found [Tom Preston-Werner][TPW] is using the same theme, lol.

I simply built this site by following the [official documentation][jekyll-doc]. There is no more to say since I haven't go deep yet. And the content is more important I think. I will use this site to track my mistakes and experience in programming. Also, I am planning to build a personal wiki based on Github, too. That wiki will focus on all the notes I made in learning. I will publish that site as soon as I created.
